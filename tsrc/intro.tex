This section should be written {\em after} the main sections are concluded. The suggested order for writing this document is the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The Background knowledge section: this section is mandatory for both PIC2 and the dissertation, which can reuse and improve it.
\item The Present Work description section: if this is the PIC2 report, this section may not exist if one still has not done any work. In the dissertation, this section is mandatory.
\item The Experimental Results section: if this is the PIC2 report, this section may not exist if one still has not done any work. In the dissertation, this section is mandatory.
\item The Introduction section: this section.
\item Write the Conclusion section.
\item Write the Abstract section.
\end{enumerate}

In this section, one should write the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Motivation: explain the problem one is trying to solve and why it is
important. Describe the main existing works on this topic (summarize from the
Background section).
\item Objective: Explain this work's goal and how it tackled the problem to
achieve it. (summarize from the Present Work section).
\item Document outline: Describe in one paragraph the contents of each main section of
the document.
\end{itemize}

This document should include tables and figures to ease the explanation. All
tables and figures must have a caption, and a label to be referenced in the
document and further explained. The reference to the table or figure is
mandatory and unreferenced tables or figures should be removed. An example is
shown in Table~\ref{tab:ex}.

\begin{longtable}{|l|c|c|p{6.4cm}|}
    \caption{Example table}\label{tab:ex}\\ \hline
    \rowcolor{iob-green}
    \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{\bf Name} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\bf Direction} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\bf Width} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\bf Description}  \\ \hline \hline
    clk & INPUT & 1 & System clock input.
 \\ \hline
\rowcolor{iob-blue}
rst & INPUT & 1 & System reset, asynchronous and active high.
 \\ \hline
\end{longtable}
