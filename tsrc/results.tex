In this section, one should explain in detail the experiments designed to show
the applicability or superiority of the proposed approach and the results
obtained. Use tables or figures to facilitate a rapid apprehension of the
results.

For example, if the goal is to design a new platform to accelerate a software
application, the execution times of the application running on the existing and
new platforms should be presented.

The resources used should be detailed: the frequency of operation, memory size,
power, energy consumption, and communication bandwidth are examples. For FPGA
implementations, for example, the number of block RAMs, LUTs, and DSPs should be
presented in a Table for the configurations studied.
