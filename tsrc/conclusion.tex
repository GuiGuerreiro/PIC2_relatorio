In this section, one should summarize the work: the problem, the current work,
the proposed solution, the results obtained, and why they improve the
state-of-art. Repeating what is written in the introduction is not a problem and
is desirable, but one should try to use different and complementary explanations
to help the user. Another vital part of this section is to explain the future
work that can be done as a follow-up to this work.
